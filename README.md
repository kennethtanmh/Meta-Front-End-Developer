Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my final capstone project, a website designed to improve online reservation functionality for the Little Lemon Mediterranean Restaurant, a popular eatery located in Chicago. This project was completed as part of the Meta Front End Developer Professional Certificate program.

## Problem Statement

The Little Lemon Mediterranean Restaurant did not have an online reservation system, which often led to customer dissatisfaction and lost business opportunities. To address this issue, I developed a modern and user-friendly web application using React to streamline the reservation process, enhancing the overall dining experience for customers.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to different devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **Smooth Scroll**: Implemented the React Scroll library to provide a smooth and delightful scrolling experience, enhancing the website's overall aesthetics.

- **Dynamic Navigation**: The navigation bar intelligently hides or appears depending on the user's scroll direction, providing a clean and distraction-free interface.

- **User-Friendly Reservation Form**: Developed a controlled form component that guides users through the reservation process, making it easy for them to provide required information.

- **Route Management**: Utilized React Router v6+ to create efficient and flexible routing, enabling smooth navigation between different sections of the website.

- **Accessibility**: Implemented ARIA attributes to ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities, prioritizing an inclusive experience for all visitors.

- **State Management**: Leveraged React's useState Hook for efficient state management, enhancing the performance and maintainability of the components.

- **LocalStorage Integration**: Utilized the localStorage API to store essential data locally, enhancing the website's responsiveness and reducing server load.

- **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: Employed CSS Flexbox and Grid to achieve responsive and visually appealing layouts across different screen sizes.

- **SEO Optimization**: Implemented Open Graph Protocol meta tags to improve the website's search engine visibility and social media sharing experience
